# We see how a dictionary is a more complex data type
# We see that we can access values inside of a dictionary if we refer to a key that is in the dictionary
# We see that dictionaries can contain many different data types. A dictionary vlues can be either a [], (), "", int, boolean, float, etc.
# We can access specific methods that are designed for dictionaries (.items)
# We can reassign or create keys inside of a dictionary by referring to the key such as 
# superhero["club"] and then we can assign it a value
# We can use the keyword del to delete a key or value from a dictionary

#JSON # type of data that you can access like a dictionary
