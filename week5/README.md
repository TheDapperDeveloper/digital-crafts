This is my first individual front-end project in my full stack development bootcamp through Digital Crafts.

The requirements were as follows:

Build a website using HTML and CSS utilizing a specific layout. The layout options were flexbox, grid, or framework. We had to used DOM manipulation while using at least one API to fetch data to be returned to the user. There needed to be a total of four HTML pages with a design theme that are mobile responsive. User input had to be received as well.

I decided to build my webpage using books as the subject matter. I attacked the most challenging part of the project first, DOM Manipulation and API. I decided to use the New York Times Book Review API so that users could enter a book title (satisfying the user input requirement) and the page would return a link to the New York Times book review article. To accomplish this I obtained the URL for the New York Times API to fetch the data then converted it to JSON. From there I used an if/else statement to return the book title, book author, article author, summary of the article and the link to the article.

The next step was to determine the layout for the pages. I decided on these four pages: Home, Recommended Reading, Book Reviews, and E-mail List. For all four pages I used a combination of grid and flexbox in CSS. Lastly, I decided on a design theme. I wanted to keep it simple and also give users a lot to look at. I used one background color and several images to make the pages pop. I also used CSS to add some animation to the pages.

This was a fun project where I learned the complexity of CSS as well as got more clarity on DOM manipulation and APIs.
